# Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub space!
I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and passionate about solving real-world problems through clean and efficient code.
I enjoy working with data, automating systems, and exploring how things scale in production environments.
Most of my work revolves around building things that run reliably, process efficiently, and solve practical problems.
I'm curious about how systems work under the hood — from low-level performance tuning to cloud-based data processing.
I like writing code that doesn't just work, but works well, at scale.
You'll often find me experimenting with new tech stacks, exploring open-source tools, or just simplifying something complex.
Big fan of clean architecture, simple logic, and smart automation.
Strong believer in learning by doing and iterating fast.
I'm comfortable working with both structured and unstructured data — transforming, storing, and delivering it in usable form.
Always looking to improve things — whether it's a pipeline, a deployment, or even just a script.
I work with Python, SQL, AWS, Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and a few other tools that make life easier.
I enjoy the balance between writing code and making systems robust and maintainable.
When I'm not coding, I like reading about systems design, exploring dev workflows, or just debugging things for fun.
My goal is to keep building, learning, and contributing to tech that actually makes an impact.
Thanks for visiting — and feel free to look around.
